            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my site report, on this page is a report icluding my overall experience learning the basics of web development, including my ups and downs with coding and designing.I will be sharing a short round up my experience while creating this website and also my desing process and the reasons and explanations behind the desgin desicions.</p>
            <h2>Experience of Learning</h2>
            <p>I have done quite a bit of web development before while in college but it was in a group project so this website was my first experience creating, desiging and coding a website solo. Before starting this assignment I decided to wait and learn a lot of the basic web delopment skills before starting the development by completing small tasks trying to learn to impliment the knowledge I have before starting this project. I wanted to refresh and relearn a lot of the elements I already knew and made sure I had all the basics down before starting the assignment itself. Like previously mentioned I have covered a lot of the basics before in college but that was a while ago and I had forgotten a lot more then I thought. So it was a very slow process to get used to it all again and I started by reminding myself of all the tags liek "nav" and "ul etc. So I created short little tasks without any css invloved just to familiarise myself with every once again. Overall this worked really well as I got to clarify in my head the basic funtions of everything I was learning before really putting them into practice and over complicating it with the css. </p>
            <p>I found learning all of the basics quite easy with a bit of practice but Github is something I have never used before, I had heard of it but never used it even at college so this was a big learning curve for me. Before learning about this like I'm sure a lot of people do, I would just save my file and refresh my broswer to see progress in my code and to keep track of what I'm doing and this obviously caused me some problems even with the little tasks I was doing as I had to rely on undoing lines of code and literally trying to guess how many times I needed to undo to get back to my working code if I messed anything up when I hit save. As mentioned this was a huge learning curve as I needed to fully learn how to use git and Github with no prior knowledge what so ever. But once I learned how to set my account up it made everything a lot simpler and allowed me to organise everything a lot better. A massive negative though is I only started using Github half way through my development of this sit so I missed out on a lot of commits which would have been very helpful when creating and setting up the first few pages.</p>
            <p>As I always do I started the design process when I found out what needed to be made and I looked at the desing brief and using a pencil and paper designed each page to get an overall layout and I idea I wanted and also listed the colour and backgound ideas I had. I created a very consistant layout through out the pages as I knew this is what I am going to be trying to code first so I can then put it into all of my pages for the layout to be through the entire website, Also the layout would use a grid layout which is also going to be very useful to put on every page to make it organised and look a lot better then if every page looked different and had a different grid layout. I would that would make it extremely confusing so have the layout consistant was a huge thing for me and it made the whole experience a lot easier and smoother.</p>
            <p>Having the lectures recorded was a massive help as I felt I could go back and watch them whenever needed and repeat that as much as needed. Also everything was very well labbeled so I while attempting the things I had learned I didn't get a specific bit I could go back and find it with no problem and make sure I understood it. This made the learning experience a lot better as I learn a lot easier by doing the tasks rather then listening so the fact I could have the lecture side by side with my own attemtp to impliment what I was learning made the experience very smooth.</p>
            <h3>Ups</h3>
            <p>I like to feel like the whole learning process was mainly ups as I did everything quite slow and in the correct order and tryed to try to my design as much as possible, each week I would learna new skill and then instantly try and impliment it to make sure I understood it before moving on. I felt because of a small amount of previous knowledge the overall code learning process was a big up becasue I already had a good idea of what everything I was learning was I just needed to refresh my mind and put it into practice. My development experience started extremly well as I created a grid layout like in my design and that really set the overall tone of the website and made it so simple to impliment everything I wanted to do inside the layout, I then simply copied over the code of the layout changing a few navigation names so every page was reachable and straight away and a template, layout and appearance of every page in the assignment. I got the hang of grids quite well which allowed me to create an organised layout but also allowed bme to experiment a bit, I came to make my portfolio page or at least made a conept of what I wanted, the brief said it needs to have images that act as placeholders for images of future work and I instantly thought I could use a grid to create a more visually appealing portfolio father then just a list of images I could create a more complex grid which allowed me to make a bunch of images all different shapes and fit on the page how I want them which turned out great.</p>
