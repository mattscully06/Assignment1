            <h1>Site Report</h1>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my site report, on this page is a report icluding my overall experience learning the basics of web development, including my ups and downs with coding and designing.I will be sharing a short round up my experience while creating this website and also my desing process and the reasons and explanations behind the desgin desicions.</p>
            <h2>Experience of Learning</h2>
            <p>I have done quite a bit of web development before while in college but it was in a group project so this website was my first experience creating, desiging and coding a website solo. Before starting this assignment I decided to wait and learn a lot of the basic web delopment skills before starting the development by completing small tasks trying to learn to impliment the knowledge I have before starting this project. I wanted to refresh and relearn a lot of the elements I already knew and made sure I had all the basics down before starting the assignment itself. Like previously mentioned I have covered a lot of the basics before in college but that was a while ago and I had forgotten a lot more then I thought. So it was a very slow process to get used to it all again and I started by reminding myself of all the tags liek "nav" and "ul etc. So I created short little tasks without any css invloved just to familiarise myself with every once again. Overall this worked really well as I got to clarify in my head the basic funtions of everything I was learning before really putting them into practice and over complicating it with the css. </p>
            <p>I found learning all of the basics quite easy with a bit of practice but Github is something I have never used before, I had heard of it but never used it even at college so this was a big learning curve for me. Before learning about this like I'm sure a lot of people do, I would just save my file and refresh my broswer to see progress in my code and to keep track of what I'm doing and this obviously caused me some problems even with the little tasks I was doing as I had to rely on undoing lines of code and literally trying to guess how many times I needed to undo to get back to my working code if I messed anything up when I hit save. As mentioned this was a huge learning curve as I needed to fulle learn how to use git and Github with no prior knowledge what so ever. But once I learned how to set my account up it made everything a lot simpler and allowed me to organise everything a lot better. A massive negative though is I only started using Github half way through my development of this sit so I missed out on a lot of commits which would have been very helpful when creating and setting up the first few pages.</p>
            <p>As I always do I started the design process when I found out what needed to be made and I looked at the desing brief and using a pencil and paper designed each page to get an overall layout and I idea I wanted and also listed the colour and backgound ideas I had. I created a very consistant layout through out the pages as I knew this is what I am going to be trying to code first so I can then put it into all of my pages for the layout to be through the entire website, Also the layout would use a grid layout which is also going to be very useful to put on every page to make it organised and look a lot better then if every page looked different and had a different grid layout. I would that would make it extremely confusing so have the layout consistant was a huge thing for me and it made the whole experience a lot easier and smoother.</p>
            <p> I started off simply by creating all the individual pages of html and css to ensure I would meet the brief and make it a lot easier to see what needed to be done and plan ahead. I then set all the pages up by creating the starting code like the header and stylesheet link to link all the pages to their css files.</p>
